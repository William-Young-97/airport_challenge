# Airport Challenge

The airport challenge involved using TDD to apply basic OOP.

## What was my approach?

My approach was to start simple and build the program up using the TDD process. Tbis meant doing: feature test, unit test, code, unit test, feature test and refactor. I pulled on similar resources that I had used throughout the Boris bikes challenge as well. I aimed for high test coverage and simple methods. 

## Where did I get too?

I finished the fourth user story, however I did not complete the fifth or sixth.

## Why was this?

I did not lay out enough time on the weekend as I only spent Sunday on the challenge. In the future I will use make sure to put in more time on both days. Additionally, I did not understand some key concepts such as doubles, and how to apply them, due to only beginning to learn about them, late Sunday evening.

## What will my approach be going forward? How will I improve?

As metioned above, I will carve out more time to do the weekend challenge next week. For this challenge to be completed I will first review the remaining concepts with my peer group. I will then apply them along with the TDD process when I have freetime to practice my Rspec.

## Conclusion

Whilst the Airport challange is similar to the Boris bikes challenge, the element of randomness, introduced by the weather, is hard to account for in TDD without a good of certain concepts. This led to the challenge taking longer than expected, and subsequently, I did not complete it within the timeframe. I will continue to practise Rspec and learn the remaining concepts to finish this challenge.
